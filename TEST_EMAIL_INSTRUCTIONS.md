# Test Email System - Now With Resend API Key

## The API Key is Now Configured! 🎉

You've successfully added the Resend API key to your Supabase dashboard. The email system should now send real emails instead of just console logs.

## Test Steps

### 1. Add a New Requirement
1. **Log in as admin** (admin@befach.com / admin123)
2. **Click "Add Requirement"** button
3. **Fill out the form** with any test product
4. **Submit the form**

### 2. Watch for Success Indicators

#### Console Logs (Should show):
```
🚀 Triggering new requirement email notification
📧 Attempting to send NEW_REQUIREMENT email for: [Your Product]
📬 Email API response status: 200
✅ Email notification result: {
  "success": true,
  "message": "1 emails sent successfully via Resend",  // ← KEY: Should be 1, not 0
  "recipients": ["dinesh.befach@gmail.com"],
  "provider": "Resend"
}
📧 1 emails sent successfully via Resend to: ["dinesh.befach@gmail.com"]
```

#### Browser Notification:
- **Green popup** in top-right corner: "📧 Emails Sent! 1 recipients notified"

### 3. Check Email Delivery
1. **Check inbox:** dinesh.befach@gmail.com
2. **Check spam folder** if not in inbox
3. **Look for email with subject:** "🚢 New Shipping Requirement: [Your Product Name]"
4. **From:** Befach International <noreply@befach.com>

## Expected Email Content

The email will include:
- **Professional Befach branding**
- **Product details** (name, HS code, MOQ, description)
- **Auction timeline** (start/end dates)
- **Call-to-action button** to view and bid
- **Mobile-responsive design**

## If It Still Shows "0 emails sent"

1. **Wait 5 minutes** - Environment variables take time to propagate
2. **Try again** - Add another requirement
3. **Check Supabase dashboard** - Verify the RESEND_API_KEY is saved correctly

## If Emails Don't Arrive

1. **Check spam/junk folder** in Gmail
2. **Check Promotions tab** in Gmail
3. **Add noreply@befach.com to contacts**
4. **Try a different email** temporarily

## Success Criteria

✅ Console shows "1 emails sent successfully via Resend"  
✅ Green browser notification appears  
✅ Email arrives in dinesh.befach@gmail.com inbox  
✅ Email has professional Befach branding  
✅ Email contains all product details
